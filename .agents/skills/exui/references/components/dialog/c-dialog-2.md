# Shadcn Scrollable Content

> Dialog with scrollable content

- Type: example, free and open source (MIT)
- Component: [Dialog](../dialog.md)
- Page: [local reference](./c-dialog-2.md)
- Docs (Base UI): https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/components/base/dialog.md
- Docs (Radix UI): https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/components/radix/dialog.md
- Uses: Button, Dialog

## Best for

Read only text in a body capped at 70vh that scrolls under the title, with no footer

## When not to use

- Scrolling content that also needs a button kept in view below it: use [Sticky Footer](./c-dialog-3.md)

## ExUI adaptation

Compose this pattern from public ExUI components; see [setup](../../exui/setup.md). This example is not an exported component or a complete TSX source file.

## About Shadcn Dialog

### When to use

- Short forms and settings that need an answer before the page continues
- Long text such as terms, read in a scrolling body that can grow to nearly full screen
- Reference overlays and notices, such as a keyboard shortcuts list or a session timeout

### When not to use

- A yes or no confirmation before a destructive action: use [Alert Dialog](../alert-dialog.md)
- Long forms or record details that slide in from the screen edge: use [Sheet](../sheet.md)
- Mobile panels that open from the bottom and close with a swipe: use [Drawer](../drawer.md)

### Agent notes

- Compose the trigger through `render` on the base twin and `asChild` on the radix twin; the other one is silently ignored
- `DialogContent` renders its own close button; pass `showCloseButton` as false to drop it
