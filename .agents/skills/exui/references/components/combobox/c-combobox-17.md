# Shadcn In Dialog

> A combobox used within a dialog

- Type: example, free and open source (MIT)
- Component: [Combobox](../combobox.md)
- Page: [local reference](./c-combobox-17.md)
- Docs (Base UI): https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/components/base/combobox.md
- Docs (Radix UI): https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/components/radix/combobox.md
- Uses: Button, Combobox, Dialog, Field

## Best for

A framework pick placed in a modal with a hidden label and Cancel and Confirm buttons in its footer

## Agent notes

- Confirm only calls `toast` and closes; the uncontrolled `Combobox` keeps its pick inside, so lift `value` into state to read it
- The radix twin sets `modal` to false on `Dialog` while the base twin stays modal; keep that difference when porting

## Third-party libraries

- Sonner v2: [API reference](https://sonner.emilkowal.ski/toast), [docs](https://sonner.emilkowal.ski/getting-started)

## ExUI adaptation

Compose this pattern from public ExUI components; see [setup](../../exui/setup.md). This example is not an exported component or a complete TSX source file.

## About Shadcn Combobox

### When to use

- Form fields that pick one option by typing to search, such as a framework, timezone or country
- Fields holding several picks as chips, such as frameworks or team members with avatars
- Task property pickers opened from a button, such as status, priority, assignee, labels, team or due date

### When not to use

- A short fixed list chosen from a button, with no typing to narrow it: use [Select](../select.md)
- A free text field that suggests matches but keeps whatever was typed: use [Autocomplete](../autocomplete.md)
- A complete signup or settings page with many fields and a submit row: use the Form blocks

### Agent notes

- Rows filter as the user types only when the function child of `ComboboxList` renders them; static `ComboboxItem` children always stay listed
- `itemToStringValue` sets only the submitted value; without itemToStringLabel, search matches an object item's label, else its value field, else its JSON
- Combobox parts take `render` in both twins, since both wrap `@base-ui/react`; `asChild` applies only to radix twin parts such as `DialogTrigger` and `Button`
