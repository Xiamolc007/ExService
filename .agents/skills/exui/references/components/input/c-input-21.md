# Shadcn Multiple Errors

> Input with multiple error messages

- Type: example, free and open source (MIT)
- Component: [Input](../input.md)
- Page: [local reference](./c-input-21.md)
- Docs (Base UI): https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/components/base/input.md
- Docs (Radix UI): https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/components/radix/input.md
- Uses: Field, Input

## Best for

A security code field listing 3 failed rules under it, each led by an alert icon

## Agent notes

- The 3 messages and `aria-invalid` are hardcoded; render the rows inside `FieldError` from your validation result

## When not to use

- Rules shown as a live checklist that ticks off while the user types: use [Strength Meter](./c-input-23.md)

## ExUI adaptation

Compose this pattern from public ExUI components; see [setup](../../exui/setup.md). This example is not an exported component or a complete TSX source file.

## About Shadcn Input

### When to use

- Labeled text, email and search fields, plain or restyled as a pill, an underline or borderless
- Native typed fields for passwords, phones, URLs, numbers, dates, times, files, colors and ranges
- Field states and hints: disabled, required or optional marks, errors, character counts and password strength

### When not to use

- Icons, buttons, units or a prefix that sit inside the border of the box: use [Input Group](../input-group.md)
- International numbers chosen by country flag and formatted as the user types: use [Phone Input](../phone-input.md)
- A whole create or edit page that gathers many fields under one save action: use the Form blocks

### Agent notes

- The red invalid border comes from `aria-invalid` on `Input` in every style; `FieldError` only prints the message
