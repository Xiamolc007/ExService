## About Shadcn Calendar

### When to use

- Inline grids for picking one day, several separate days or a from and to range
- Date and date range fields that open the grid in a popover under a trigger button
- Booking and planning steps that pair a day with time slots, daily prices or an event list

### When not to use

- A filter over day, month, quarter or year periods with before, after and between operators: use [Date Selector](../date-selector.md)
- A ready made booking widget with host details, duration choices and a confirm step: use the Schedule blocks
- A month, week or day view of entries that users drag, resize and create: use [Event Calendar](../event-calendar.md)

### Agent notes

- `selected` takes a `Date`, a `Date` array or a `DateRange` to match `mode` single, multiple or range
- Without `required`, clicking the only selected day clears it, so `onSelect` can hand back `undefined` or an empty array
