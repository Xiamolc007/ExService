## Best for

A Message name over a multi line text area for longer free text, with no counter or hint

## When not to use

- A message box that shows how many characters are used as the user types: use [Character Counter](./c-label-9.md)

## ExUI adaptation

Compose this pattern from public ExUI components; see [setup](../../exui/setup.md). This example is not an exported component or a complete TSX source file.

## About Shadcn Label

### When to use

- Visible names for text inputs, text areas and checkboxes, each tied to its control by id
- Marks beside the field name: required or optional, a status badge or dot, an info tooltip or an edit toggle
- Field states and hints around the name: disabled, invalid, helper text under it and a live character count

### When not to use

- Form rows that need hint and error slots, grouped sets or a side by side layout: use [Field](../field.md)
- The text box itself, with typed entry for email, password, number or file: use [Input](../input.md)
- Lists of tick boxes, a mixed state or selectable cards with a ticked state: use [Checkbox](../checkbox.md)

### Agent notes

- Every `htmlFor` and its matching `id` is a fixed string such as `label-required`; make each pair unique when a field renders more than once
- `data-disabled` on `Field` does not dim a plain `Label`, whose dim rule needs an unnamed `group` ancestor while `Field` is a named group
