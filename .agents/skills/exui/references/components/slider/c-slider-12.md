# Shadcn Emoji Rating

> Rating slider with emoji feedback

- Type: example, free and open source (MIT)
- Component: [Slider](../slider.md)
- Page: [local reference](./c-slider-12.md)
- Docs (Base UI): https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/components/base/slider.md
- Docs (Radix UI): https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/components/radix/slider.md
- Uses: Label, Slider

## Best for

A 1 to 5 experience score that swaps a face emoji beside the track and a word such as Okay under it

## Agent notes

- `emojis` and `labels` are read at `value` minus 1, so keep each list as long as `max` while `min` stays 1

## When not to use

- A score shown as stars that people click, or as an average in a list: use [Rating](../rating.md)

## ExUI adaptation

Compose this pattern from public ExUI components; see [setup](../../exui/setup.md). This example is not an exported component or a complete TSX source file.

## About Shadcn Slider

### When to use

- Settings tuned by dragging along a bounded scale, such as volume, opacity or color temperature
- Ranges picked with 2 or more thumbs on a single track, laid out horizontally or vertically
- Durations, storage sizes and scores read off tick marks, scale labels, a value bubble or an emoji

### When not to use

- A complete shop facet panel with brands, colors, sizes and a price range: use the Filter Sidebar blocks
- A value typed straight into a box, such as an exact price, with no scale to drag: use [Input](../input.md)
- A read only bar that reports how far a task or upload has got: use [Progress](../progress.md)

### Agent notes

- The base `Slider` draws a thumb per entry of an array `value` or `defaultValue`; a plain number gets 2 stacked thumbs and 2 tab stops
- `htmlFor` on a `Label` reaches only the root div of the base `Slider`, not its thumb input; name the slider with aria-labelledby instead
- Base `onValueChange` is typed as a number or a read only array, so narrow it with `Array.isArray`; the radix twin passes a number array
