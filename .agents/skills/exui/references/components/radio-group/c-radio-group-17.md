## Best for

Free, Pro and Enterprise tiers mapped from an array, each row pairing the name with a monthly price over a pitch

## Agent notes

- Replace `plans` with your tiers; `price` renders with a fixed /mo suffix and each `value` doubles as the item `id`

## When not to use

- Plan tiles that carry only a name and a pitch, with no price: use [Descriptive Cards](./c-radio-group-7.md)

## ExUI adaptation

Compose this pattern from public ExUI components; see [setup](../../exui/setup.md). This example is not an exported component or a complete TSX source file.

## About Shadcn Radio Group

### When to use

- Short single choice lists in forms and settings, such as density, visibility, role or release channel
- Option tiles and divided card rows for shipping speed, contact method, language or a teammate
- Checkout and plan steps that pick one saved payment method or one priced subscription tier

### When not to use

- A list where any number of the options can be ticked together: use [Checkbox](../checkbox.md)
- A whole modal step built around one choice, such as a template or a sync scope: use the Dialog blocks
- A full plan table with billing period tabs and a feature list per tier: use the Pricing blocks

### Agent notes

- Every example seeds `RadioGroup` through `defaultValue` and reads nothing back; pass a controlled value and a change handler to act on the pick
- No example sets a name on `RadioGroup`, so a native form post carries no choice; add one when the group lives in a form
- Every `RadioGroupItem` `id` is a fixed string such as r1 or an option value; derive unique ids when a group can render twice on one page
