# Shadcn Positions

> Toast positions

- Type: example, free and open source (MIT)
- Component: [Sonner](../sonner.md)
- Page: [local reference](./c-sonner-3.md)
- Docs (Base UI): https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/components/base/toast.md
- Docs (Radix UI): https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/components/radix/sonner.md
- Uses: Button

## Best for

A grid of 6 buttons that each send their toast to a different top or bottom corner or center

## Agent notes

- Each call passes its own `position`; pick one and set it on `Toaster` so every toast shares that spot

## Third-party libraries

- Sonner v2: [API reference](https://sonner.emilkowal.ski/toast), [docs](https://sonner.emilkowal.ski/getting-started)

## ExUI adaptation

Compose this pattern from public ExUI components; see [setup](../../exui/setup.md). This example is not an exported component or a complete TSX source file.

## About Shadcn Sonner

### When to use

- Brief feedback after an action, such as a created event or an archived message with Undo
- Progress of async work in one toast that updates in place, from loading to success or failure
- Rich notifications for messages, invites, deploys, builds and integrations, with their own buttons

### When not to use

- A status or warning that must stay on the page until the problem is fixed: use [Alert](../alert.md)
- A choice the user has to make before the page can carry on: use [Alert Dialog](../alert-dialog.md)
- An inbox panel that lists past activity for the user to review on demand: use the Sheet blocks

### Agent notes

- The examples ship only the sonner package and never render `Toaster`; mount the shadcn sonner `Toaster` once near your app root or no `toast` shows
