## About Shadcn Sonner

### When to use

- Brief feedback after an action, such as a created event or an archived message with Undo
- Progress of async work in one toast that updates in place, from loading to success or failure
- Rich notifications for messages, invites, deploys, builds and integrations, with their own buttons

### When not to use

- A status or warning that must stay on the page until the problem is fixed: use [Alert](../alert.md)
- A choice the user has to make before the page can carry on: use [Alert Dialog](../alert-dialog.md)
- An inbox panel that lists past activity for the user to review on demand: use the Sheet blocks

### Agent notes

- The examples ship only the sonner package and never render `Toaster`; mount the shadcn sonner `Toaster` once near your app root or no `toast` shows
