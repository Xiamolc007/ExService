## About Shadcn Pagination

### When to use

- Numbered page links between previous and next controls under a list, a table or search results
- Compact pagers of back and forward controls alone or beside a page count, for narrow spaces
- Table footers pairing page controls with a rows per page select, a range count or a page jump field

### When not to use

- A records table that sorts and filters its rows and needs its pager built in: use [Data Grid](../data-grid.md)
- A whole table section with a title, toolbar, rows and a working pager: use the Base blocks
- Page controls kept in local state that run click handlers, with no URL per page: use [Button Group](../button-group.md)

### Agent notes

- `PaginationLink` renders its own anchor and takes neither `render` nor `asChild`; swap that anchor for your router link in your copy of the component
- Every `href` is a hash placeholder and each page number, count and current page is typed in; derive them from your page state or URL
