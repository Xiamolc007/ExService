# Shadcn Empty State

> Avatar inside an empty state example

- Type: example, free and open source (MIT)
- Component: [Avatar](../avatar.md)
- Page: [local reference](./c-avatar-28.md)
- Docs (Base UI): https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/components/base/avatar.md
- Docs (Radix UI): https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/components/radix/avatar.md
- Uses: Avatar

## Best for

A no collaborators prompt with 3 grayscale photos, an add person chip and invite copy below

## Agent notes

- `AvatarGroupCount` carries an aria-label but stays a non focusable div, so wrap it in a button before wiring the invite

## When not to use

- A blank page or panel state with its own icon, title and action buttons: use [Empty](../empty.md)

## ExUI adaptation

Compose this pattern from public ExUI components; see [setup](../../exui/setup.md). This example is not an exported component or a complete TSX source file.

## About Shadcn Avatar

### When to use

- Profile photos with initials or a user icon that stand in when the picture is missing or fails
- Presence dots, verified marks and number badges pinned to the corners of a person's photo
- Overlapping team stacks, social proof rows and user chips inside buttons or account triggers

### When not to use

- An account panel opened from a trigger, with the name, email and grouped actions: use [Dropdown Menu](../dropdown-menu.md)
- A full account settings page where a person edits photo, name and details: use the Profile blocks
- A workspace members directory with roles, invites and access status: use the Users blocks

### Agent notes

- Initials inside `AvatarFallback` are typed by hand in every example; derive them from each person's name rather than copying the sample letters
- A square `Avatar` needs the same radius on `AvatarImage`, `AvatarFallback` and its after pseudo element border, since all 3 default to round
