# Shadcn Disabled Button

> Tooltip on disabled button with wrapper

- Type: example, free and open source (MIT)
- Component: [Tooltip](../tooltip.md)
- Page: [local reference](./c-tooltip-12.md)
- Docs (Base UI): https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/components/base/tooltip.md
- Docs (Radix UI): https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/components/radix/tooltip.md
- Uses: Button, Tooltip

## Best for

A disabled Delete Project button wrapped in a span trigger, so the reason it is locked still shows on hover

## Agent notes

- The `span` trigger is not focusable and the disabled `Button` skips Tab, so keyboard users never see the reason; give the span tabIndex 0

## ExUI adaptation

Compose this pattern from public ExUI components; see [setup](../../exui/setup.md). This example is not an exported component or a complete TSX source file.

## About Shadcn Tooltip

### When to use

- Short labels for buttons and icon only toolbar actions, with a keyboard shortcut where one exists
- Help text on an info icon, a warning, a verified mark, a locked feature or a disabled button
- Compact summaries behind a trigger, such as service status, notifications, file details or a person

### When not to use

- Content with links or buttons that keyboard users must be able to reach: use [Popover](../popover.md)
- A rich profile or page preview with a large photo, bio and dates: use [Hover Card](../hover-card.md)
- A status or count that stays readable without pointing at anything: use [Badge](../badge.md)

### Agent notes

- Outside a `TooltipProvider` the base `Tooltip` opens after 600ms and inside one at once; the radix `Tooltip` throws without one
- `TooltipTrigger` renders a `button` of its own, so a `Button` nested in it without `render` or radix `asChild` makes a button in a button
- `TooltipContent` is portaled to the end of the body with no focus guards, so a link or button in it is not next in Tab order after its trigger
