## About Shadcn Chart

### When to use

- Trend cards that plot monthly or weekly figures as bars, areas or a line
- Part to whole breakdowns such as traffic sources, task status or plan tiers as donut and pie slices
- Score profiles across several axes, such as team skills or audit results, as radar or radial bars

### When not to use

- A finished metric card with period tabs, KPI tiles and a range switcher built in: use the Area Chart blocks
- Headline numbers with trend badges and no plotted series: use the Stats blocks
- A whole overview page with summary tiles above a trend and a work list: use the Dashboard blocks

### Agent notes

- Replace the sample `chartData` array, and give each series or slice name it uses a `chartConfig` entry with a label and color
- Each example caps its `Card` at `max-w-md` or `max-w-xs`; drop the cap so the chart fills a grid cell
- `ChartContainer` sizes itself by `aspect-video` unless a class overrides it, so set an aspect ratio or height class to fit a fixed tile
