## Best for

Email opt-in checkboxes with one locked on, then a public or private radio choice, each under its own legend

## When not to use

- Delivery channels flipped on and off by switches, not ticked: use [Notification Preferences](./c-field-10.md)

## ExUI adaptation

Compose this pattern from public ExUI components; see [setup](../../exui/setup.md). This example is not an exported component or a complete TSX source file.

## About Shadcn Field

### When to use

- Labeled inputs, selects, text areas and code entry with optional hint text under the control
- Preference and permission lists where every switch or checkbox has a title and a description
- Validation states with a red label and one error, or a list of them, under the control

### When not to use

- A complete page for entering or editing a record, such as an invoice or a profile: use the Form blocks
- A full page of toggle rows for alert channels, app integrations or workspace options: use the Settings blocks
- A numeric value stepped with plus and minus buttons or scrubbed by dragging: use [Number Field](../number-field.md)

### Agent notes

- `FieldTitle` is a plain div, so a `Checkbox` or `Switch` titled only by it has no accessible name; point a `FieldLabel` at its id instead
- `data-invalid` on `Field` only sets a red text color, which its label inherits; the control turns red from aria-invalid, which no example sets
- Nothing ties `FieldDescription` or `FieldError` to the control; give them ids and list those in the control's aria-describedby
