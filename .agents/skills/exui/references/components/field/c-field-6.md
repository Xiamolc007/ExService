# Shadcn OTP Input

> Field with OTP input

- Type: example, free and open source (MIT)
- Component: [Field](../field.md)
- Page: [local reference](./c-field-6.md)
- Docs (Base UI): https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/components/base/field.md
- Docs (Radix UI): https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/components/radix/field.md
- Uses: Field, Input Otp, Native Select

## Best for

A native select of delivery methods above a 6 slot code split 3 and 3 by a separator

## Agent notes

- `NativeSelect` and `InputOTP` have no handlers, so send the code by the picked method and check the 6 digits yourself

## When not to use

- A code entry on its own, with no delivery method picker above it: use [Input Otp](../input-otp.md)

## Third-party libraries

- input-otp v1: [API reference](https://input-otp.rodz.dev/docs/api), [docs](https://input-otp.rodz.dev/docs), through shadcn Input Otp

## ExUI adaptation

Compose this pattern from public ExUI components; see [setup](../../exui/setup.md). This example is not an exported component or a complete TSX source file.

## About Shadcn Field

### When to use

- Labeled inputs, selects, text areas and code entry with optional hint text under the control
- Preference and permission lists where every switch or checkbox has a title and a description
- Validation states with a red label and one error, or a list of them, under the control

### When not to use

- A complete page for entering or editing a record, such as an invoice or a profile: use the Form blocks
- A full page of toggle rows for alert channels, app integrations or workspace options: use the Settings blocks
- A numeric value stepped with plus and minus buttons or scrubbed by dragging: use [Number Field](../number-field.md)

### Agent notes

- `FieldTitle` is a plain div, so a `Checkbox` or `Switch` titled only by it has no accessible name; point a `FieldLabel` at its id instead
- `data-invalid` on `Field` only sets a red text color, which its label inherits; the control turns red from aria-invalid, which no example sets
- Nothing ties `FieldDescription` or `FieldError` to the control; give them ids and list those in the control's aria-describedby
