# Shadcn API Request

> API request input with method selector and send action

- Type: example, free and open source (MIT)
- Component: [Input Group](../input-group.md)
- Page: [local reference](./c-input-group-36.md)
- Docs (Base UI): https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/components/base/input-group.md
- Docs (Radix UI): https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/components/radix/input-group.md
- Uses: Dropdown Menu, Field, Input Group

## Best for

An API endpoint bar led by a color coded GET, POST, PUT, PATCH or DELETE menu and ending in Send

## Agent notes

- On the base twin each method row sets `method` from `onSelect`, which a Base UI menu never calls, so it stays GET; use `onClick`
- Send has no handler; call your API with `method` and the endpoint path from it

## ExUI adaptation

Compose this pattern from public ExUI components; see [setup](../../exui/setup.md). This example is not an exported component or a complete TSX source file.

## About Shadcn Input Group

### When to use

- Text fields with a leading icon, prefix or suffix text, a unit or a status mark inside one border
- Search, link and API bars that end in a copy, clear, filter, menu or send control
- Prompt and comment composers: a text area with a toolbar row above or below the text

### When not to use

- Selects, fields and actions joined edge to edge, each keeping its own border: use [Button Group](../button-group.md)
- A plain text field with no icon, text or action inside its border: use [Input](../input.md)
- A complete assistant screen with a message thread above the prompt box: use the AI Chat blocks

### Agent notes

- The border turns red from `aria-invalid` on the control; `data-invalid` on `Field` only tints text, so set both as `c-input-group-3` does
- Addon icons and text never name the control; tie a `FieldLabel` to the input or textarea id as `c-input-group-20` does, or give it an aria label
- `InputGroupButton` defaults `type` to button, so pass submit when it should send the surrounding form
