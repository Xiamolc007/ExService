## About Shadcn Dropdown Menu

### When to use

- Action and overflow menus on a button or a dots icon, such as edit, duplicate, share, export and delete
- Account, workspace and create menus showing the signed in user, workspace switching and sign out
- Toggles, exclusive choices and short lists, such as panel layout, theme, AI models or recent alerts

### When not to use

- Actions opened by right clicking or long pressing a surface, with no button to press: use [Context Menu](../context-menu.md)
- A whole top bar with search, alerts, switchers and the user dropdown already placed: use the Navbar blocks
- The account settings page an avatar link opens, with identity, team and billing forms: use the Profile blocks

### Agent notes

- `DropdownMenuLabel` throws on the base twin unless it sits inside a `DropdownMenuGroup` or `DropdownMenuRadioGroup`
- On the base twin run an item's action from `onClick`; `onSelect` is a Radix item event that Base UI never fires
- Pass the trigger element through `render` on the base twin and as the `asChild` child on radix; the prop meant for the other twin does nothing
