## About Shadcn Card

### When to use

- Titled sections with body copy and footer actions, such as a help notice or a sign in form
- Image tiles with a photo above the copy or filling the tile under a dark text overlay
- Dashboard widgets such as a KPI with a trend, a usage meter or a deployment or integration status

### When not to use

- A finished grid of KPI tiles, feature links or profile records ready to drop in: use the Card blocks
- A KPI panel with a range filter, a segmented meter or an activity feed beneath it: use the Stats blocks
- A preview that pops up over a link while the pointer rests on it: use [Hover Card](../hover-card.md)

### Agent notes

- Each example caps `Card` with `max-w-xs`, `max-w-sm` or `max-w-md`; drop the cap when the card should fill a grid cell or column
- `size` sm on `Card` tightens padding and gaps in every style; none of these examples sets it, so try it before padding overrides
