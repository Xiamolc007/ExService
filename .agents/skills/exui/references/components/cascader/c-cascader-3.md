# Shadcn Deep Search

> Deep search across every level with path-annotated results.

- Type: example, free and open source (MIT)
- Component: [Cascader](../cascader.md)
- Page: [local reference](./c-cascader-3.md)
- Uses: Button, Cascader

## Best for

A source file tree whose search reaches files below the open folder, with folder paths telling repeated names like page.tsx apart

## When not to use

- Search that covers the whole tree while a nested level is open: use [Global Search](./c-cascader-21.md)

## ExUI adaptation

Compose this pattern from public ExUI components; see [setup](../../exui/setup.md). This example is not an exported component or a complete TSX source file.

## About Shadcn Cascader

### When to use

- Form fields that commit one value from a nested tree, such as a category, region, file or department
- Picking several nodes at once, such as permissions, report columns or shipping zones with cascading checks
- Deep or large hierarchies as Miller columns, an expanding tree, an inline panel or levels fetched on demand

### When not to use

- A short flat list of options with no nesting: use [Select](../select.md)
- A folder hierarchy browsed on the page rather than picked into a form field: use [Tree](../tree.md)
- A table of records whose cells are edited in place and saved together: use the Editing blocks

### Agent notes

- Parts live in separate files with no index: `CascaderItems` comes from `cascader-item`, while `CascaderInput` and `CascaderValue` come from `cascader-nav`
- Give every node a `value` that is unique across the whole tree, not only within its level; a repeated `value` silently drops the later row
