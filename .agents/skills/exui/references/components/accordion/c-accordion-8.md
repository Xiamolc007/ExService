# Shadcn Nested

> Nested accordion example with bordered items

- Type: example, free and open source (MIT)
- Component: [Accordion](../accordion.md)
- Page: [local reference](./c-accordion-8.md)
- Docs (Base UI): https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/components/base/accordion.md
- Docs (Radix UI): https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/components/radix/accordion.md
- Uses: Accordion

## Best for

A product details list where one section opens onto its own inner set of sub sections, both levels open on load

## Agent notes

- An entry in `mainItems` with `isNested` renders the inner `Accordion` from `nestedItems` in place of its `content`

## When not to use

- A flat list of boxed questions with no second level inside: use [Bordered Rounded](./c-accordion-3.md)

## ExUI adaptation

Compose this pattern from public ExUI components; see [setup](../../exui/setup.md). This example is not an exported component or a complete TSX source file.

## About Shadcn Accordion

### When to use

- Help and FAQ sections where each question opens its own answer
- Settings, plans, product details and onboarding steps grouped into sections that expand on demand
- Lists of people or records that open to show detail, such as team members and roles

### When not to use

- One block of extra content shown and hidden by a single trigger: use [Collapsible](../collapsible.md)
- A complete questions section for a landing page, with heading and support prompt: use the FAQ blocks
- Switching between views of the same space where exactly one is always shown: use [Tabs](../tabs.md)

### Agent notes

- The base twin takes `multiple` and an array `defaultValue`; the radix twin takes `type`, and `defaultValue` is a string only when `type` is single
- A closed `AccordionContent` ships no text in the server HTML of either twin unless kept mounted, so crawlers without JS never read it
