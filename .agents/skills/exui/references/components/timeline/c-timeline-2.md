# Shadcn Roadmap

> Timeline with roadmap.

- Type: example, free and open source (MIT)
- Component: [Timeline](../timeline.md)
- Page: [local reference](./c-timeline-2.md)
- Uses: Timeline

## Best for

Dates set in a right aligned column left of the line from the sm breakpoint, folding above each title on phones

## Agent notes

- The date column is a fixed `w-20` that wraps longer dates; widen it by growing the item `ms-32` and the date's left offset by the same step

## ExUI adaptation

Compose this pattern from public ExUI components; see [setup](../../exui/setup.md). This example is not an exported component or a complete TSX source file.

## About Shadcn Timeline

### When to use

- Project milestones, product roadmaps and release histories, stacked or laid out in a row
- Activity feeds and logs such as git events, deploy runs and team member actions
- Progress through ordered stages, such as order shipping or a build pipeline

### When not to use

- A ready made activity feed, approval tracker or changelog to drop into a page: use the Timeline blocks
- A full page audit log of access events grouped by day, with filters and export: use the Users blocks
- A multi step form or setup flow the user clicks through, one panel at a time: use [Stepper](../stepper.md)

### Agent notes

- `onValueChange` never fires, since no part changes the step on click or key; progress moves only when you pass a new `value`
- `defaultValue` is 1 when omitted, which sets `data-completed` on the `TimelineItem` with `step` 1; pass 0 when nothing is done yet
- Keep each `TimelineItem` a direct child of `Timeline`; wrapping one in an element hides its `TimelineSeparator` as if it were the last item
